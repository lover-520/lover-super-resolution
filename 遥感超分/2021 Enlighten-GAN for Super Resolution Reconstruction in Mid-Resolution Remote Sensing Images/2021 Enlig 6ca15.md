## Abstract

> Previously, generative adversarial networks (GAN) have been widely applied on super resolution reconstruction (SRR) methods, which turn low-resolution (LR) images into high-resolution(HR) ones. However, as these methods recover high frequency information with what they observed from the other images, they tend to produce artifacts when processing unfamiliar images. Optical satellite remote sensing images are of a far more complicated scene than natural images. Therefore, applying the previous networks on remote sensing images, especially mid-resolution ones, leads to unstable convergence and thus unpleasing artifacts. In this paper, we propose Enlighten-GAN
for SRR tasks on large-size optical mid-resolution remote sensing images. Specifically, we design the enlighten blocks to induce network converging to a reliable point, and bring the Self-Supervised Hierarchical Perceptual Loss to attain performance improvement overpassing the other loss functions. Furthermore, limited by memory, large-scale images need to be cropped into patches to get through the network separately. To merge the reconstructed patches into a whole, we employ the internal inconsistency loss and cropping-and-clipping strategy, to avoid the seam line. Experiment results certify that Enlighten-GAN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of gradient similarity metric (GSM) on mid-resolution Sentinel-2 remote sensing images.

现有的方法从影像中恢复高频信息，但是当涉及到新领域的不熟悉的图片时很容易产生伪影；特别是应用现有的方法在遥感影像中会产生不好的伪影。
针对大范围的中分辨率遥感影像，提出了Enlighten-GAN；主要的改进有：

1. 设计 enlighten blocks ，网络朝着可信的方向进行收敛；
2. Self-Supervised Hierarchical Perceptual Loss 自监督的分层感知损失；
3. 针对遥感影像较大需要裁剪存在明显的缝合线的问题，提出了 internal inconsistency loss  和 cropping-and-clipping strategy

## Introduction

前面介绍内容比较基础，主要贡献点和摘要中写得差不多

> According to the aforementioned issues, in this paper, we propose an SRR method called Enlighten-GAN that primarily focuses on mid-resolution remote sensing images.
The Enlighten-GAN struggles to induce network converging to a stable and reliable point by varied means. Our main contributions are listed below.
• We design a novel Enlighten-GAN with an enlighten block. The enlighten block benefits the network by setting an easier target to ensure it receives effective gradient. Owing to the varied scale reconstructed results, the enlighten block gains even higher generalization ability. Our proposed Enlighten-GAN proves itself in our comparison experiments on Sentinel-2 images, exceeding the state-of-the-art methods.
• We introduce and employ a Self-Supervised Hierarchical Perceptual Loss for training rather than the conventional perceptual loss defined with VGGNet [15], which is more suitable for SRR-like tasks. We conduct ablation experiment to verify its effectiveness.
• To address the merging issue, we propose a clipping-and-merging method with a learning-based batch internal inconsistency loss, by which the seam lines in the predicted large-scale remote sensing images are dismissed.
