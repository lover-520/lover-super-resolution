## Comments

- 这篇文章中采用高分辨Google作为参考影像，第一次将RefSR的思想应用到遥感领域的超分中，并通过梯度图的思想支持图像对齐；
- 从实验数据的情况来看，个人感觉实验数据存在一些问题，Ref的Google存在配准的问题，时相上也可能导致地物发生变化，甚至有的Ref影像有云，这又是怎么可能进行纹理信息迁移的；从实验结果上进行分析来看，视觉感观上有些结果并没有太大区别；
- 文章的思路不错，之后个人感觉可以在这种RefSR的思路上，高分辨率的Google提供纹理特征，尽可能地保证边缘信息超分准确，或者是使用PAN信息提供边缘信息，(PAN相对于Google，受地理信息偏移的影响应该更小，损失函数中感知损失其实会导致纹理信息不真实的情况，也可以后续进行改进)

## Abstract

> Remote sensing image super-resolution (SR) plays an important role by supplementing the lack of original high-resolution (HR) images in the study scenarios of large spatial areas or long time series. However, due to the lack of imagery information in low-resolution (LR) images, single-image super-resolution (SISR) is an inherently ill-posed problem. Especially, it is difficult to reconstruct the fine textures of HR images at large upscaling factors (e.g., four times). In this work, based on Google Earth HR images, we explore the potential of the reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) method on remote sensing images, utilizing rich texture information from HR reference(Ref) images to reconstruct the details in LR images. This method can use existing HR images to help reconstruct the LR images of long time series or a specific time. We build a reference-based remote sensing SR data set (RRSSRD). Furthermore, by adopting the generative adversarial network (GAN), we propose a novel end-to-end reference-based remote sensing GAN (RRSGAN) for SR. RRSGAN can extract the Ref features and align them
to the LR features. Eventually, the texture information in the Ref features can be transferred to the reconstructed HR images. In contrast to the existing RefSR methods, we propose a gradient-assisted feature alignment method that adopts the deformable convolutions to align the Ref and LR features and a relevance attention module (RAM) to improve the robustness of the model in different scenarios (e.g., land cover changes and cloud coverage). The experimental results demonstrate that RRSGAN is robust and outperforms the state-of-the-art SISR and RefSR methods in both quantitative evaluation and visual results, which indicates the great potential of the RefSR method for remote sensing tasks.

## Introduction

> In recent years, single-image super-resolution (SISR) has received great attention. There are many SISR-related studies, especially deep learning-based methods. However, because the textures of HR images are excessively destructed in the degrading process and are difficult to be recovered, the convolutional neural network-based (CNN-based) SISR methods often result in blurry effects. To address this issue, the generative adversarial network-based(GAN-based) SISR methods are proposed and lead to breakthroughs on the visual quality. However, GAN-based SISR methods tend to generate fake textures and even produce artifacts. Moreover, due to the limited prior knowledge and the lack of imagery information in a single LR image, it is still a challenging problem to reconstruct the fine textures of HR at large upscaling factors (e.g., four times).

在连续卷积的过程中HR的纹理特征回出现损坏，基于CNN的方法容易产生模糊的效果，基于GAN的方法会导致假的纹理信息甚至产生伪影，同时先验知识有限；

> In the computer vision field, some studies have diverted from SISR and explored reference-based SR(RefSR). RefSR introduces additional reference images to compensate for the lost details in the LR images. The state-of-the-art methods follow the pattern of combining image alignment or patch matching and texture synthesis. Existing RefSR studies are mainly based on two different types of assumptions: 1) the Ref images and LR images are aligned well or have high content similarity (e.g., the same object from different viewpoints or video frames) or 2) the Ref images and LR images sometimes are significantly misaligned or have uncertain content similarity (e.g., from web image searches). However, the above assumptions do not fully match the remote sensing scenario in this article, mainly due to the following two reasons.
1. In remote sensing tasks, the HR Ref images can be easily matched to the LR images at the same location using the latitude and longitude information. Therefore, the Ref and LR images have a certain content similarity. However, image alignment is still necessary due to the different shooting viewpoints, which results in the different tilting directions of tall buildings, and deviation in geographic coordinates (usually within several pixels). The challenges of alignment are the large spectral difference between different sensors, land cover changes at different times, shifts in the viewpoint, and illumination variations.
2. Due to inevitable land cover changes, cloud coverage, and missing HR Ref images, there are higher requirements for the robustness of the model, especially in the Ref texture transfer process.

现有先进技术采用的方式是采用图像配准和纹理合成的技术；现有的Ref的超分方法主要有两个假设：Ref和LR图像是否对齐，是否具有较高的内容相似性；但是这并不适用于遥感影像方面的超分；
1) Ref与LR图像地理坐标对齐但是仍需要配准，存在一些光谱差异；
2) 缺少高分辨率的HR、Ref图像；

The contributions of our work are summarized as follows.
1. To the best of our knowledge, we are one of the first to explore RefSR on remote sensing images. Based on the publicly available HR images from Google Earth, we build an open-source reference-based remote sensing super-resolution data set (RRSSRD).
2. We propose an end-to-end RefSR approach for remote sensing images, named RRSGAN. RRSGAN contains a feature extraction and alignment module, a multi-level texture transformer, and GAN-based losses in both image and gradient domains. Considering the mis-alignment problem between LR and Ref images and model robustness with different qualities of Ref images, we propose a GAFA method and an RAM to further release the potential of RefSR in remote sensing scenarios.
3. We demonstrate that our proposed RRSGAN is superior to both the state-of-the-art SISR methods and existing RefSR methods on RRSSRD. Our proposed method is also robust with different qualities of Ref images and performs well in real-world images. This work proves the great potential of the RefSR approach in the field of remote sensing.

分别计算SR、Real的梯度gradient

两个鉴别器分别判断一张图是SR image还是Real image和对梯度图进行判断是SR的gradient还是Real gradient；

**损失函数loss function：**

reconstruction loss、adversarial loss、perceptual loss三部分

reconstruction loss尽可能地保留空间信息，是HR图像与LR图像之间的L1范数；

adversarial loss旨在生成清晰的图像，是GAN的损失函数；

perceptual loss加强视觉上的相似性，这个好像是以前的网络中就采用的损失函数，以VGG19作为基本网络；

**数据集**

这里的分辨率不同应该之后使用了resize方法吧，0.5m的和0.6m的怎么可能会对得齐呢；

Ref中也存在一些压根就没对齐的区域，地物发生变化、存在阴影等；
