## Comments

* 文章将SS和SR进行结合，但是SS仍然是作为辅助任务，起到一个计算loss优化的作用；
* 文章中提到域适应的问题，就是从源域中学习到目标域中肯定会存在gap的问题啊，直接在一个域中进行学习不好嘛？
* 文章中需要格外注意GT和HR作者所指代的意思，GT是语义分割的ground truth，HR是超分辨率的高分辨率影像；
* 对，超分的数据集的确没有语义分割的label，这样要结合语义分割的话可能的确只能将其作为auxiliary task计算loss，进行优化；

## Abstract

> Real-world single image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to enhance the resolution and reconstruct High-Resolution(HR) details of real Low-Resolution (LR) images. This is different from the traditional SR setting, where the LR images are synthetically created, typically with bicubic downsampling. As the degradation process for real-world LR images are highly complex, SR of such images is much more challenging. Recent promising approaches to solve the **Real-World Super-Resolution (RWSR)** problem include the use of **domain adaptation** to create realistic training-pairs, and **self-learnin**g based methods which learn an image specific SR model at test time. However, as domain adaptation is an inherently challenging problem in itself, SR models based solely on this approach are limited by the domain gap. In contrast, while self-learning based methods remove the need for paired-training data by utilizing internal information in the LR image, these methods come with the cost of slow prediction times. **This paper proposes a novel framework, Semantic Segmentation Guided Real-World Super-Resolution (SSG-RWSR)**, **which uses an auxiliary semantic segmentation network to guide the SR learning.** This results in noise-free reconstructions with accurate object boundaries, and enables training on real LR images. The latter allows our SR network to adapt to the image specific degradations, without Ground-Truth (GT) reference images. We support the guidance with domain adaptation to faithfully reconstruct realistic textures, and ensure color consistency. We evaluate our proposed method on two public available datasets, and present State-of-the-Art results in terms of perceptual image quality on both real and synthesized LR images.

Title：基于语义分割指导的真实世界超分

Abstract：真实世界的LR退化过程过于复杂，近期的方法采用domain adaptation和self-learning的方法，domain adaptation仍然有迁移的问题，self learning速度较慢，因此提出了一种新框架，Semantic Segmentation作为辅助任务；

## Introduction

> Traditionally, most work has been focusing on improving the fidelity of the images by minimizing the Mean Squared Error (MSE).
> 

传统的超分方法都是最小化MSE；

> Current State-of-the-Art (SoTA) deep learning-based SR methods most often require paired LR/HR images to be trained by supervised learning. Commonly, researchers have been using artificial LR images created by downsampling HR images, typically using bicubic interpolation.
> 

最近的SoTA方法都需要paired images，LR一般有HR bicubicbu

基于域适应的方法可以生成与真实LR相似的LR，自学习不需要配对样本，但推理时间过长，于是本文作者移出了一种不同GT或者先验知识的新框架。

• We propose a novel framework for RWSR which allows learning from real LR images without requiring the corresponding GT images.
• We propose to guide the learning of the RWSR task with the loss of a semantic segmentation network, which helps to reconstruct sharp and noise-free HR images.
• We show that domain adaptation and guidance by the segmentation loss is complementary to each other, and improves the texture and fine details of the recon-
structed images, compared to using guidance by the segmentation loss alone.
• Our method is trained end-to-end without any manual parameter tweaking.
• We show SoTA results for RWSR on two publicly available datasets of both real and synthesized LR images.

贡献点：

1. 新框架，能够从LR中进行学习，而不需要对应的GT；(我觉着这里需要注意的是，这篇文章中描述的GT和HR不是同一个概念，GT是指语义分割的groundtruth)
2. 添加了语义分割的损失，重建高频信息图像；
3. domain adaptation和segmentation loss是互补的，比单独使用segmentation能够更有效地改善纹理和细节信息；
4. 端到端，不需要任何人工参数微调；
5. 结果SoTA；
